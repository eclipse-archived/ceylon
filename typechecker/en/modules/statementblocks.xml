    <para>Function, value, and class bodies contain procedural code that is executed 
    when the function is invoked, the value evaluated, or the class instantiated. The 
    code contains expressions and control directives and is organized using blocks 
    and control structures.</para>
    
    <comment><para>Note: the Ceylon language has a recursive block structure&mdash;statements

    of a control structure, and vice-versa.</para></comment>

            <comment><para>Note: there is an apparent ambiguity here. Is the statement
            <literal>x=1;</literal> a value specification statement, or an assignment 
            expression statement? The language resolves this ambiguity by favoring the
            interpretation as a specification statement whenever that interpretation is
            viable. This is a transparent solution, since it accepts strictly more code 
            than the alternative interpretation, and for ambiguous cases the actual 
            semantics are identical between the two interpretations.</para></comment>

        <comment><para>Control structures are not considered to be expressions, and therefore 
        do not evaluate to a value. However, comprehensions&mdash;and conditional expressions, 
        planned for a future release of the language&mdash;are part of the expression syntax 
        and share much of the syntax and semantics of the control structures they resemble.

        <para><emphasis>Assertions</emphasis> are runtime checks upon program invariants, or 
        function preconditions and postconditions. An assertion failure represents a bug in
        the program, and is not considered recoverable. Therefore, assertions should not be 
        used to control "normal" execution flow.</para>
        
        <comment><para>Note: of course, in certain circumstances, it is appropriate to handle
        the exception that results from an assertion failure, for example, to display a message
        to the user, or in a testing framework to aggregate and report the failures that occurred
        in test assertions. A test failure may be considered "normal" occurrence from the point 
        of view of a testing framework, but it's not "normal" in the sense intended above.
