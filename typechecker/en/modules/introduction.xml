    <para>This document defines the syntax and semantics of the Ceylon language.
    The intended audience includes compiler implementors, interested parties
    who wish to contribute to the evolution of the language, and experienced 
    developers seeking a precise definition of language constructs. However, in
    light of the newness of the language, we will begin with an overview of the
    main features of the language and SDK. A brief introduction to programming 
    in the language may be found at the following address:</para>

        <title>Language overview</title>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon is a general-purpose programming  language featuring a syntax similar 
    to Java and C#. It is imperative, statically-typed, block-structured, 
    object-oriented, and higher-order. By <emphasis>statically-typed</emphasis>, 
    we mean that the compiler performs extensive type checking, with the help of 
    type annotations that appear in the code. By <emphasis>object-oriented</emphasis>, 
    we mean that the language supports user-defined types and features a nominative 
    type system where a type is a set of named attributes and operations, and that 
    it supports inheritance and subtype polymorphism. By <emphasis>higher-order</emphasis>, 
    we mean that every referenceable program element (every attribute, every 
    operation, and every type) is also a value. By <emphasis>block-structured</emphasis>, 
    we mean to say that the language features lexical scoping and an extremely 
    regular recursive syntax for declarations and statements.

    <para>
    Ceylon programs execute in any standard Java Virtual Machine or on any
    JavaScript virtual machine, and take advantage of the memory management and 
    concurrency features of the virtual machine in which they execute. Ceylon
    programs are packaged into <emphasis>modules</emphasis> with well-defined
    inter-module dependencies, and always execute inside a runtime environment 
    with module isolation.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    The Ceylon compiler is able to compile Ceylon code that calls Java classes or 
    interfaces, and Java code that calls Ceylon classes or interfaces. JavaScript
    code is able to call Ceylon classes and functions compiled to JavaScript.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon improves upon the Java language and type system to reduce verbosity 
    and increase typesafety compared to Java and C#. Ceylon encourages a more 
    functional, somewhat less imperative style of programming, resulting in code 
    which is easier to reason about, and easier to refactor. Moreover, Ceylon 
    provides its own native SDK as a replacement for the Java platform class 
    libraries.

    <title>The type system</title>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon, like Java, features a hybrid type system with both subtype polymorphism 
    and parameteric polymorphism. A type is either a stateless <emphasis>interface</emphasis>, 
    a stateful <emphasis>class</emphasis>, a <emphasis>type parameter</emphasis>, or 
    a <emphasis>union</emphasis> or <emphasis>intersection</emphasis> of other types.
    A class, interface, or type parameter may be defined as a subtype of another type.
    A class or interface may declare type parameters, which abstract the definition 
    of the class or interface over all types which may be substituted for the type 
    parameters.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    There are no primitive types or arrays in Ceylon&mdash;every Ceylon type can 
    be represented within the language itself. So all values are instances of the 
    type hierarchy root <literal>Anything</literal>, which is a class. However, the 
    Ceylon compiler is permitted to optimize certain code to take advantage of the 
    optimized performance of primitive types on the Java or JavaScript VM.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    The type system is based upon computation of <emphasis>principal types</emphasis>.
    Within the language, there is no way to produce an expression which does not
    have a unique principal type expressible within the language itself. The 
    principal type is a subtype of all other types to which the expression could
    be assigned.
    </para>
    
    </section>
    
    <section id="mixininheritance">
    <title>Mixin inheritance</title>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon supports a restricted form of multiple inheritance, often called 
    <emphasis>mixin inheritance</emphasis>. A class must extend exactly one other 
    class. But a class or interface may satisfy (extend or implement) an arbitrary 
    number of interfaces.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Classes hold state and define logic to initialize that state when the class is 
    instantiated. A concrete class is a class that contains only concrete member 
    definitions. Concrete classes may be directly instantiated. An abstract class 
    may contain formal member declarations. Abstract classes may not be instantiated.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Interfaces may define concrete members, but may not hold state (references to 
    other objects) or initialization logic. This restriction helps eliminate the 
    problems traditionally associated with multiple inheritance. Ceylon never 
    performs any kind of "linearization" of the supertypes of a type. Interfaces 
    may not be directly instantiated.
    </para>
    
    </section>
    
    <section id="algrebraictypesselftypes">
    <title>Algebraic types, self types, and type families</title>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon does not feature Java-style enumerated types as a first-class construct. 
    Instead, any abstract type may specify its <emphasis>cases</emphasis>&mdash;an
    enumerated list of instances and/or subtypes. This facility is used to simulate 
    both enumerated types and functional-style "algebraic" (sum) types. 
    </para>
    
    <programlisting>interface Identity of Person | Organization { ... }</programlisting>
    
    <para>
    A closely related feature is support for <emphasis>self types</emphasis> and 
    <emphasis>type families</emphasis>. A self type is a type parameter of an 
    abstract type (like <literal>Comparable</literal>) which represents the type of 
    a concrete instantiation (like <literal>String</literal>) of the abstract type,
    within the definition of the abstract type itself. In a type family, the self 
    type of a type is declared not by the type itself, but by a containing type 
    which groups together a set of related types.

    <section id="simplifiedgenerics">
    <title>Simplified generics and fully-reified types</title>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon does not support Java-style wildcard type parameters, raw types, or any 
    other kind of existential type. And the Ceylon compiler never even uses any kind 
    of "non-denotable" type to reason about the type system. So generics-related 
    error messages are understandable to humans.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Instead of wildcard types, Ceylon features <emphasis>declaration-site variance</emphasis>. 
    A type parameter may be marked as covariant or contravariant by the class or 
    interface that declares the parameter.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon has a somewhat more expressive system of generic type constraints with 
    a cleaner, more regular syntax. The syntax for declaring constraints on a type 
    parameter looks very similar to a class or interface declaration. Ceylon supports 
    upper bound type constraints and <emphasis>enumerated bounds</emphasis>.
    </para>
    
    <programlisting>interface Producer&lt;out Value&gt; 
        given Value satisfies Object { ... }</programlisting>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon's type system is fully reified. In particular, generic type arguments 
    are reified, eliminating many problems that result from type erasure in Java.

    <section id="unionandintersectiontypes">
    <title>Union and intersection types</title>

    <para>
    A <emphasis>union type</emphasis>, for example <literal>String|Number</literal>, 
    or <emphasis>intersection type</emphasis>, for example <literal>String&amp;Number</literal>,
    may be formed from two or more types defined elsewhere. 
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Union types make it possible to write code that operates polymorphically 
    over types defined in disparate branches of the type heirarchy without the 
    need for intermediate adaptor classes. Intersection types make it possible 
    to operate polymorphically over all subtypes of a list of types.
    </para>
        
    <para>
    Union and intersection types play a central role in generic type argument 
    inference and therefore underly the whole system of principal typing.

    uses generic types, eliminating the need to repeatedly specify generic
    type arguments.

    <para>
    Ceylon features an especially elegant approach to generic type argument 
    inference, making it possible to instantiate container types, even 
    inhomogoneous container types, without the need to explicitly mention any 
    types at all.

    <programlisting>value numbers = { -1, 0, -1, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0 };</programlisting>
    
    <para>
    By limiting type inference to local declarations, Ceylon ensures that all 
    types may be inferred by the compiler in a single pass of the source code. 
    Type inference works in the "forward" and "outward" directions. The compiler 
    is able to determine the type of an expression without considering the rest 
    of the statement or declaration in which it appears.

    <section id="initializationandinstantiation">
    <title>Class initialization and instantiation</title>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon does not feature any Java-like constructor declaration and so each 
    Ceylon class has a parameter list, and exactly one 
    <emphasis>initializer</emphasis>&mdash;the body of the class. This helps
    reduce verbosity and results in a more regular block structure.

    The Ceylon compiler guarantees that the value of any attribute of
    a class is initialized before it is used in an expression.

    <para>
    A class may be a member of an outer class. A member class may be refined 
    (overridden) by a subclass of the outer class. Instantiation is therefore 
    a polymorphic operation in Ceylon, eliminating the need for factory methods
    in some circumstances.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon provides a streamlined syntax for defining an anonymous class which 
    is only instantiated in exactly the place it is defined. Among other uses,
    the <literal>object</literal> declaration is useful for creating singleton 
    objects or method-local interface implementations.

    <title>Methods and attributes</title>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon types have members: <emphasis>methods</emphasis> and 
    <emphasis>attributes</emphasis>. Ceylon methods are similar to Java methods. 
    However, Ceylon classes do not contain fields, at least not in the 
    traditional sense. Instead, Ceylon supports only a higher-level construct: 
    polymorphic attributes, which are similar to C# properties. Attributes 
    abstract the internal representation of the state of an object. An attribute 
    of a class may be refined (overridden) by a subclass of the class.

    <para>The Ceylon compiler guarantees that the value of any local declared in 
    the body of a method or attribute is initialized before it is used in an 
    expression.</para>
    
    <para>
    By default, an attribute or local may not be assigned a new value after
    its initial value has been specified. Mutable attributes and variable 
    locals must be explicitly declared using the <literal>variable</literal> 
    annotation.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    There are no <literal>static</literal> members. Instead, 
    <emphasis>toplevel</emphasis> methods and attributes are declared as direct 
    members of a package. This, along with certain other features, gives the 
    language a more regular block structure.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon does not support method overloading. Each method of a type has a 
    distinct name.

    <section id="defaultparameters">
    <title>Defaulted parameters and variadic parameters</title>

    Instead of method and constructor overloading, Ceylon supports parameters

    <section id="compilerenforcednamingconventions">
    <title>Naming conventions, annotations, and inline documentation</title>
    
    <para>
    The Ceylon compiler enforces the traditional Smalltalk naming convention:
    type names begin with an initial uppercase letter&mdash;for example, 
    <literal>Liberty</literal> or <literal>RedWine</literal>&mdash;member names 
    and local names with an initial lowercase letter or underscore&mdash;for
    example, <literal>blonde</literal>, <literal>immanentize()</literal> or 
    <literal>boldlyGo()</literal>.
    </para> 
    
    <para>
    This restrictions allows a much cleaner syntax for program element 
    annotations than the syntax found in either Java or C#. Declaration 
    "modifiers" like <literal>shared</literal>, <literal>abstract</literal>, 
    and <literal>variable</literal> aren't keywords in Ceylon, they're ordinary 
    annotations.

    <section id="compiletimesafety">
    <title>Compile-time safety for optional values and type narrowing</title>
    
    <para>
    There is no primitive null in Ceylon. The null value is an instance of 
    the class <literal>Null</literal> that is not assignable to user-defined 
    class or interface types. An <emphasis>optional type</emphasis> is a 
    union type like <literal>Null|String</literal>, which may be abbreviated
    to <literal>String?</literal>. An optional type is not assignable to a 
    non-optional type except via use of the special-purpose 
    <literal>if (exists ... )</literal> construct. Thus, the Ceylon compiler 
    is able to detect illegal use of a null value at compile time. Therefore, 
    there is no equivalent to Java's <literal>NullPointerException</literal> 
    in Ceylon.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Similarly, there are no C-style typecasts in Ceylon. Instead, the 
    <literal>if (is ... )</literal> and <literal>case (is ... )</literal> 
    constructs may be used to narrow the type of an object reference without 
    risk of a <literal>ClassCastException</literal>. The combination of
    <literal>case (is ... )</literal> with algebraic types amounts to a kind
    of language-level support for the visitor pattern.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Alternatively, <emphasis>type assertions</emphasis>, written 
    <literal>assert (is ... )</literal> or <literal>assert (exists ... )</literal>
    may be used to narrow the type of a reference.

    <section id="sequences">
    <title>Sequences and tuples</title>
    
    <para><emphasis>Sequences</emphasis> are Ceylon's version of arrays. 
    However, the <literal>Sequential</literal> interface does not provide 
    operations for mutating the elements of the sequence. Because this 
    interface so useful, a type like <literal>Sequential&lt;String&gt;</literal> 
    may be abbreviated to <literal>String[]</literal>.</para>
    
    <para>A <emphasis>nonempty sequence</emphasis> is a kind of sequence

    <section id="firstclassfunctions">
    <title>First-class functions and higher-order programming</title>
    
    <para>
    Ceylon supports first-class function types and higher-order functions, 
    with minimal extensions to the traditional C syntax. A method declaration
